# Gmod-VJ-Phantom-SNPCs-Re-Summoned-PROTOTYPE-W.I.P-
This is the current version of the new Phantom SNPCs update I'm working on, expect errors and missing entities. I will update this alot.


Just extract the archive to steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons and call it quits, then launch GMod and it should be on the npc list, it won't be on the addon list so don't freak out.


This will be updated frequently so stay tuned for my next big projects!
