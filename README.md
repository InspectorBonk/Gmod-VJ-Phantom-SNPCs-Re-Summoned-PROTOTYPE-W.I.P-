# Gmod-VJ-Phantom-SNPCs-Re-Summoned-PROTOTYPE-W.I.P-
This is the current version of the new Phantom SNPCs update I'm working on, expect errors and missing entities. I will update this alot.


Just extract the archive to steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons

then launch GMod and you'll see the snpcs when you start up and go into the npc category, it won't be on the addon list on the main menu so don't freak out.


The abyss lurker is a W.I.P. snpc so it is currently non-existant, ignore it


This will be updated frequently so stay tuned for my next big projects!
